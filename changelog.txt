  -notes on how to update the code after an API breaking change
[+] API additions
[-] Bug fixes/internal changes

1.0.0rc6 - Changes from 1.0.0rc5 below
* EntityId is now signed
* Tile map class reworked
* Textures and animations use pixel sizes instead of percent
* Improved RAII in Window and Application
* MessageBus is now non-copyable
* Renamed EntityComponent to EntityController
+ Added update() to EntityController
+ HSV color object added
+ Camera can now zoom
+ Added FrameTimer utility class
+ RepeatedQuad now has proper scrolling
+ Added support for disabling key repeat in sdl2 backend
+ Added getCurrentState function in game state machine
+ Attributes of renderables are copied 
- Removed ASM optimisation for noise
- Various bugs etc

1.0.0rc5 - Changes from 1.0.0rc4 below
+ Added options to enable native CPU optimisations (Thanks Mischa-Alff)
- Use FindOpenAL and FindOpenGL for emscripten (Thanks jP_wanN)
- Fixed bug in texture recreation
- Fixed some cmake asm compiler variables (Thanks FredYeye)
- Added GLM_FORCE_RADIANS to supress warning
- Fixed find_path in FindJsonCpp.cmake (Thanks jP_wanN)
- Optimized C++ version of simplex noise
- Cleaning up code
- SDL2 backend now sets GL version properly

1.0.0rc4 - Changes from 1.0.0rc3 below
* Moved messaging classes to util
    -Change includes and linking accordingly
* Deleted fea::Message
    -Since the message bus can send objects of any type, you are now
	recommended to send data structs. the FEA_DECLARE_MESSAGE macro now
	reflects this and declares a struct. usage:
	FEA_DECLARE_MESSAGE(SomethingMessage, float data1; int32_t data2;);
* Moved LooseNTree into util module.
    -Use this include path: <fea/util/loosentree.hpp>
+ Can now add custom uniforms to any drawable.
+ Created util module.
+ Added pathfinding class.
+ TextSurface now has word wrap functionality.
+ TextSurface now interprets "\n" as a new line.
+ There are now convenience aliases for the loosentree to reflect QuadTree and Octrees. (Thanks jP_wanN)
+ Added various noise functions. (simplex noise, white noise, voronoi noise) (Thanks Fred).
+ Added [ui]64vec[23] to glm type adder.
- Minor audio bug fixes.
- Minor entity system fixes.
- Minor bug in FindCMake module.

1.0.0rc3 - Changes from 1.0.0rc2 below
* Exchanged libsndfile in favour of libvorbisfile
    -No other formats than .ogg currently supported
    -No longer need to supply libsndfile as dependency
    -Dependency added: libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile
* Changed include directories to fea
    -Change all #include <featherkit/*> to <fea/*>
* Tile maps returns pointers in chunklist
    -Dereference pointers before passing to the renderer
* Tile map using int32_t for IDs instead of strings
    -addTileDefinition and setTile must be used with int32_t
* Colors reworked to work with bytes instead of float
    - .r() and .setR() work with uint32_t now. for floats, use
	.rAsFloat()/.setRAsFloat()
* Removed util namespace
    -Omit /util/ from includes and ::util from accesses.
* JsonCpp used for json loading instead of json0
    -Provide the dependency to build json loaders
	-A new cmake option BUILD_JSON can be set to false to not use json
* Entity json format changed.
    -See
	http://featherkit.therocode.net/docs/classfea_1_1util_1_1JsonEntityLoader.html
+ Setting colours on the text surface's text possible
+ Shader now supports arrays
+ Added entityKept/entityDropped function pair to entity components
+ Tilemaps now have set/get for: parallax, opacity, colour, origin, rotation
+ Orientation of tiles can be set in the tilemap
+ Camera now also has transform/untranfsorm functions
and scale
+ Added default colours like fea::Color::Black etc.
+ EFX related functionality can now be switched off from cmake
