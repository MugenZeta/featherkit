     *  @class ActionHandler
     *  @brief Provides a way to bind raw input to actions. 
     *
     *  When an input which is bound to an action is received, the corresponding action is generated. Actions are not defined in any way and could be anything from a player jump action, to a quit the game action. For example, the keyboard key Keyboard::SPACE could be bound to the action BITE which would make the player bite in front of him. The data type of the actions is configurable using the template argument.
     *
     *  The ActionHandler lets you poll actions in a way similar to how the InputHandler lets you poll input events. These actions can the be used to control the game. By using actions instead of raw input in the game, key configurations and platform portability is a lot easier to setup since only the bindings need to be changed. Generated actions are stored until they are polled or until the action handler is cleared using the ActionHandler::clearActions() function.
     *
     *  The event types that can be bound are EventType::KEYPRESSED, EventType::KEYRELEASED, EventType::MOUSEBUTTONPRESSED, EventType::MOUSEBUTTONRELEASED, EventType::GAMEPADBUTTONPRESSED and EventType::GAMEPADBUTTONRELEASED.
     *
     *  Both primary and secondary bindings can be bound to an action. Both the primary and secondary input event will trigger the action. For instance, if you bind BITE primarily to Keyboard::SPACE and secondarily to Keyboard::G, pressing either space or g will generate the action.
     *
     *  If a binding is created for an input or action so that it would conflict an already existing binding, the old binding will be overwritten and not valid anymore.
     *  @tparam Type which is used as the action type.
     ***
     *  @fn void ActionHandler::feedEvent(const Event& event)
     *  @brief Feed an event to the ActionHandler
     *
     *  If the ActionHandler currently has bindings related to the event given, appropriate actions will be generated and stored. 
     *  All events has to be fed to the ActionHandler using this function, or there will be no actions to poll.
     *
     *  @param event Event to feed.
     ***
     *  @fn bool ActionHandler::pollAction(Action& action)
     *  @brief Access the frontmost action in the action queue, removing it from the ActionHandler in the process.
     *  @param action Action instance in which to store the frontmost action.
     *  @return True if an action was given, or false if the action queue was empty. If this is false, then the value of the action given as an argument will be undefined.
